He was a consistent team player despite working very remotely from our home base. He was extremely knowledgeable, committed and communicative. Any team would be lucky to have Jack working with them.'

> Absolute Import is a great way to clean up your imports

## Example

This is the usual way of importing with `..` operator to go back 1 folder:

```jsx
import Nav from '../../components/Nav';
```

And this is the clean import using absolute import:

```jsx
import Nav from '@/components/Nav';
```

# For Next.js

## Add this to root with the filename of `jsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", ".next"]
}
```

# For Create React App

## Add this to root with the filename of `jsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["./components/*"],
      "@/pages/*": ["./pages/*"],
      "@/contexts/*": ["./contexts/*"],
      "@/routes/*": ["./routes/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

## And in craco.config.js

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ...existing code
  webpack: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    },
  },
};
```
